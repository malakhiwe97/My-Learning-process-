Welcome to my Learning Process repository.

This folder documents my personal learning journey in becoming a highly skilled Data Analyst and future AI professional. The projects here are self-driven and completed outside of my Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics at Emeris. These are practical exercises, mini-projects, and experiments that help me build real-world analytical skills.

## Purpose of This Folder

# The goal of this repository is to:

Strengthen my technical foundation in data tools

Practice solving real-world data problems

Develop analytical thinking and decision-making skills

Build a strong portfolio aligned with industry standards

Move from learning concepts → to applying them

Everything here reflects consistent self-improvement and discipline in mastering data.
